## numml: Differentiable numerics for PyTorch

A library for PyTorch providing sparse, differentiable CSR support.

### Installation

Clone normally and install with pip,
```
pip3 install .
```

If CUDA is not detected on your system, this will silently default to compiling only CPU
implementations: you can run pip with verbose (`-v`) for a sanity check on this.

### Tests

Run tests using pytest like
```
pytest numml/tests
```

Note that the test cases will assume you are running on a machine with CUDA installed and you have compiled with CUDA support.
